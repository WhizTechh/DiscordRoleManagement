# DiscordRoleManagement (DiscordGivingRemovingRoles)
The program can automatically distribute/remove roles to all members and/or bots from a server.<br>
## Functionality
Copy the server and role ID that you want to transfer to people or remove, select whether all (members and bots) are affected,<br>only bots or only members. Then click on <b>ADD TO EVERYONE</b> or <b>REMOVE FROM EVERYONE</b> to add or remove the corresponding role.
## Note
You need a bot token to be able to use the application! To do this, create a new application in the <a href="https://discord.com/developers/applications">Discord Developer Portal</a> and extract the token from the bot.
The code can be freely customized and used for private purposes.<br>
